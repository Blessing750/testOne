//JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, 
//in web applications, for game development, and lots more
// in a programming language, variables are used to store data values
// In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
// hyphens are not allowed in javascript


/* statements
Statements are used in JavaScript to control its program flow.
Keyword	and Description
var	Declares a variable
let	Declares a block variable
const	Declares a block constant
if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	Declares a function
return	Exits a function
try	Implements error handling to a block of statements

we have 2 types of javascript syntax
1. fixed values are called literals
under literals we have numbers and strings
2. variable values are called variable 
under variable we have let, const and var
let and var tells the browser to ceate variable and they produce the same result



Javascript operators are +, -, *, / 


All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ 
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.



What is block scope and function scope in JavaScript?
Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
function and cannot be used outside that function.
Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch
conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.


Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

difference between let and var is that let cannot be redeclared while var can be redeclared

you can use a variable using the var keyword before declaring it but you cannot use it with the let keyword

A const variable cannot be reassigned:
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:


const keyword does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object  
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object



The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

JavaScript object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods
array is a single variable that is used to store different elements


A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. 
Each key-value pair is called a property.
object allows you to store multiple collections of data

methods are actions that can be performed on an object
A method is a function stored as a property.

EVENTS : are things that hapen to the html elements
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.


Event	Description
onchange	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	The browser has finished loading the page
